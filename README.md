# Churn_telco_prediction
Problem Statement:

Customer churn is a significant challenge for businesses in various industries. It represents the loss of customers, which can lead to revenue decline, increased customer acquisition costs, and a decrease in market share. Accurately predicting customer churn early in the process allows businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers and mitigate the financial impact of churn.

Project Overview:

In this project, you will build a deep learning model to predict customer churn using a dataset of customer information. The model will analyze various customer attributes, such as their spending patterns, demographics, and product usage, to identify patterns that are indicative of churn risk. You will then containerize the deep learning model using Docker to deploy it in a production environment.

Tech Stack:

* Python: For data processing, data manipulation, and deep learning model development

* Data Analytics: Utilize libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization

* SQL: Extract and clean customer data from relational databases using SQL queries

* Deep Learning: Employ a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to build the churn prediction model

* Docker: Package and deploy the deep learning model as a Docker image for deployment in production environments
